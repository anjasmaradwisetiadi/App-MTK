### Reason choice technology 
For this project I use 2 technologies to create this simple application, namely: Tailwind Css, React Js, and Jest unit testing.
some of the reasons I can give are:

- ReactJs
1. UI-Based Components
React.js enables modular UI development through reusable components, making code more structured and easy to maintain.
2. Virtual DOM
With Virtual DOM, React.js provides optimal performance, especially for dynamic applications that require fast UI updates.
3. Strong Ecosystem
React has a large ecosystem, with many libraries and tools that support it, such as React Router for navigation and state management such as Redux or Context API.
4. Popularity and Community Support:
As one of the most popular front-end frameworks, React has strong community support and complete documentation, making it easy for developers to solve problems that arise during development.

- Tailwind CSS
1. Utility-First CSS
Tailwind CSS enables development with a utility-first approach, which speeds up styling by using utility classes directly in the markup, reducing the need to write custom CSS.
2. Customizable
Tailwind can be easily customized to your project through a configuration file, allowing for large-scale customization of colors, spacing, typography, and more without writing CSS from scratch.
3. Easy Responsive Design
Tailwind provides utility classes for various screen sizes, making it easy to implement responsive design without having to manually write media queries.
4. Integration with React
Tailwind CSS works great with React, allowing for styling of components directly within JSX, making development faster and more efficient.
5. Performance Optimization
Tailwind removes unused CSS through the purging feature, ensuring that the resulting CSS files remain small and optimized for performance.

- Jest unit testing
1. Easy to Use and Learn
Jest is designed to be easy to use, even for developers new to testing. Simple syntax and comprehensive documentation make Jest quick to learn and implement in projects.
2. Strong Integration with JavaScript Ecosystem
Jest works great with popular frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, and Node.js. Jest supports ES6+, TypeScript, and JSX, making it highly flexible for a wide range of modern JavaScript projects.
3. Fast Performance
Jest is designed to run in parallel on multiple threads, thus increasing the speed of test execution. In addition, Jest has a smart testing feature, which only runs tests that are affected by the latest changes in the code.
4. Powerful Mocking Features
Jest provides a built-in mocking feature, allowing developers to easily mock external functions, modules, or components during testing. This is especially important in unit testing to ensure that tests remain isolated.
5. Good Reporting and Debugging
Jest has clear and descriptive output, making it easy to understand test results and detect errors. Jest also supports features like coverage reporting and interactive watch mode, which are very helpful in continuous development.
